Keep a story of your ambition with ABit.It traces your steps when you persist by filling
little blocks like GitHub does.What's more, when you keep on it every day, you'll see a
colorful image appear, yet gray before filled, to encourage you.

## Environment
	
I'm currently using Android Studio 1.3.2 with Android Build Tools 22.1, Gradle 1.3.0

## Developers

Welcome to contribute to this project.I'm trying to finish doc's editing and add some new features.In addition, I'm looking forward to advices.Here are some ideas not implemented:

*	**Add new progress images programmingly.**Currently I draw them and code them manually into the XML files.
*	**More powerful sharing and sync function.**Though a partial screenshot can be generated and shared in Facebook now, I hope content here is able to be synchronized in cloud and users can get it everywhere.
*	**Link to other apps.** I want to create a interface so that other apps about sports, study and so on are able to keep progress on ABit.Because they are good at detecting credible information of users' progress.
